Description: A dynamic time warping (DTW) based statistical framework for
    assessing temporal gene expression similarity and identifying genes with
    temporally differential progressions. It contains four metrics that jointly
    assess gene pair temporal similarity: percentage of alignment for (1) the query and
    for (2) the reference, respectively; (3) aligned gene expression correlation; (4)
    likelihood of alignment arising by chance. These four metrics will give
    temporal similarity assessments on different aspects. For genes with temporal
    similar patterns, TimeMeter will partition temporally aligned time points into
    separate segments via piecewise regression. The differential progression between
    gene pairs will be scored by aggregation of progressions difference in each
    segment.
